    "## About Intel Extension for PyTorch\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch* is a very popular framework for deep learning, while also compute-heavy package demanding perfromance optimizations. Intel and Facebook* having been collaborating to boost PyTorch* CPU Performance. The official PyTorch has been optimized using oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN) primitives by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "To deliver the latest and greatest  optimizations, Intel Optimizations for Pytorch offers accelerations beyond the stock Pytorch via **Intel® Extension for PyTorch***(IPEX). IPEX is a Python package to extend the official PyTorch with optimizations for extra performance boost on Intel hardware. Most of the optimizations will be included in stock PyTorch releases eventually, and the intention of the extension is to deliver up-to-date features and optimizations for PyTorch on Intel hardware, examples include AVX-512 Vector Neural Network Instructions (AVX512 VNNI) and Intel® Advanced Matrix Extensions (Intel® AMX).\n",
    "\n",
    "More detailed tutorials are available at [Intel® Extension for PyTorch* online document website](https://intel.github.io/intel-extension-for-pytorch/).\n",

    "Traditionally if you want to run a model with a low precision type, you need to convert the parameters and the input tensors to the low precision type manually. And if the model contains some operators that do not support the low precision type, then you have to convert back to Float32. Round after round until the model can run normally.\n",
